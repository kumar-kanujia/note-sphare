### A note taking web app
I'm excited to share with you a web clone app of Notion that I built using nextjs, tailwind, convex and clerk. Notion is a powerful tool for organizing your projects, notes, tasks and more. I was inspired by @CodeWithAntonio's FullStack Notion Clone tutorial. I wanted to challenge myself and learn new technologies, so I decided to use nextjs for server-side rendering, tailwind for styling, convex for data storage and clerk for authentication.

### Used Following Libs
- Blocknote as Test Editor
- Clerk as Authentication client
- Convex as API client
- tailwind as css framework
- shadcn for multiple components
- lucid-react, redux-ui for some ui components
- sonner for Toasts
- emoji-picker-react
- zustand for state management
